Youâ€™re the social media manager of @WildHorse. For each month since @WildHorse 
registered, calculate how many comments they received total. Plot the cumulative values 
(time on X axis, number of comments on the Y axis). Based on the historical growth 
rate, predict how many months until the total number of comments on their posts 
reaches 200.
